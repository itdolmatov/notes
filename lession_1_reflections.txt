What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros. Developers could separate changes.
    Cons Developers could forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIT operates with repositories not with separate files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

could break something?
